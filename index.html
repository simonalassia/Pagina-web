        <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of payment; can be exchanged on the Internet for goods and services.
            Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, which can be exchanged specifically for the goods or services the company offers.
            Cryptocurrencies are managed on blockchains, a decentralized technology for managing and recording transactions distributed among many computers.
            
            A great attraction of this technology is the security of the transactions.

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to present the same capabilities as humans, such as reasoning, learning, creativity and the ability to plan.
            AI allows technological systems to perceive their environment, relate to it, solve problems and act with a specific purpose. The machine receives data (already prepared or collected through its own sensors, for example a camera), processes it and responds to it.
            AI systems can adapt their behavior to a certain extent, analyze the effects of previous actions, and work autonomously.

        <h3>Blockchain</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is a shared and immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in an enterprise network. An asset can be tangible (a house, a car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and costs for everyone involved.

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning is a scientific discipline in the field of Artificial Intelligence that creates systems that learn automatically. Learning in this context means identifying complex patterns in millions of pieces of data. The machine that really learns is an algorithm that reviews the data and is able to predict future behavior. Automatically, also in this context, implies that these systems improve autonomously over time, without human intervention. let's see how it works

        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming or scripting language that allows you to implement complex functions on web pages, every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to see, it displays timely content updates, interactive maps, 2D/3D Graphic animation, scrolling video playback machines, etc., you can bet JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>it is the most basic component of the Web. Defines the meaning and structure of web content. In addition to HTML, other technologies are generally used to describe the appearance/presentation of a web page (CSS) or the functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS is used to design and style web pages, for example, by altering the font, color, size, and spacing of content, dividing it into multiple columns, or adding animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle start to CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, the syntax, and how you can start using it to add styles to HTML.

        <h3>Web APIs</h3>
        <p>An API is an application programming interface (API: Application Programming Interface). It is a set of routines that provides access to functions of a certain software.
            They are published by software builders to allow access to low-level or proprietary features, detailing only how each routine should be carried out and the functionality it provides, without providing information about how the task is carried out. They are used by programmers to build their applications without the need to reprogram functions already made by others, reusing code that is known to be tested and to work correctly.
            On the web, APIs are published by sites to provide the ability to perform some action or access some feature or content that the site provides.
